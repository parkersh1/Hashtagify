# Concerto

Concerto is designed to revolutionize the way users discover and share concerts. Our platform focuses on promoting emerging artists and facilitating music lovers to find live music events in their vicinity. By bridging the gap between new musicians and potential audiences, Concerto aims to offer a seamless and inclusive experience for all music enthusiasts.

## Problem Statement

In the era of information overload, finding concise and relevant details about live concerts can be cumbersome. Users often find themselves navigating through multiple platforms to gather essential information such as ticket availability, venue details, and event dates. The existing systems, biased towards well-known musicians, further limit the exposure of emerging artists. Our observation indicates that platforms like TicketMaster, despite their efforts, fall short in providing a clutter-free and focused solution for concert discovery, particularly for concerts by new artists.

## Our Solution: Concerto

Concerto emerges as a dedicated platform allowing users to find and upload concerts in their area. It aims to:

- Enhance the visibility of new and emerging artists.
- Simplify the discovery process for users seeking live music events.
- Provide an uncluttered interface focused solely on concerts.
