# Spotif-AI

Spotif-AI is designed to transform how users interact with and understand Spotify's music recommendation algorithm. Our platform allows users to upload their own playlists and share it with other users on the platform. Users will be shown new playlists from other users in order to expand their music library.

## Problem Statement

Spotify's current algorithm lacks transparency, often resulting in a biased and limited music discovery experience. Users find it difficult to understand why certain tracks are recommended and often miss out on discovering new or lesser-known artists.

## Our Solution: Spotif-AI

Spotif-AI serves as an innovative platform that:
- Increases transparency of the recommendation process.
- Gives users control over the data influencing their music suggestions.
- Promotes discovery of new and emerging artists.

### Features

- **User-Driven Recommendations:** Users can upload their playlists and receive suggestions based on a clearer, adjustable algorithm (based on similar songs/artists/tags)
- **Community Engagement:** Users share and discover playlists, enhancing their music exploration.

## Target Audience

- **Spotify Users:** Those looking to refine their music discovery process.
- **Data Enthusiasts:** Users interested in understanding and influencing the algorithms that shape their listening habits.

## Impact

Spotif-AI aims to democratize music recommendation by providing a user-centered approach that enhances understanding and broadens musical landscapes, ultimately fostering a richer music discovery experience for all.
