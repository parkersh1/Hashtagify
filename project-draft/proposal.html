        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Our general topic is allowing users to find and upload concerts in their area.
            We hope to give more coverage to new artists while allowing users to discover new concerts in their area,
            potentially ones that they might not have otherwise found.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the current system, users have to navigate through multiple websites to gather all the necessary
            information for a concert such as ticket availability or venue details. Additionally, the current system
            is biased towards popular musicians as major ticketing platforms like TicketMaster tend to upload concerts
            that are more likely to be profitable. It leads to the limitation of less-known musicians’ performance opportunities. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, TicketMaster is attempting to solve this problem, but their solution is cluttered and includes non-concert events.
            This makes it difficult for the user to find their favorite artists, and the sponsored events aspect makes it difficult
            for new artists to find their crowd.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The users for this application, which means people who will be accessing the websites, are any person
            who would like to attend concerts and any musicians who would like to advertise their concerts. This app
            could have a great impact on minority groups of new musicians who have not achieved big popularity yet to
            advertise their concerts. With this app, users will be able to find information about concerts near their locations
            and can upload their concerts if they are conducting any concerts. The interactive features of this app will be
            uploading concert information, sorting concert information based on the user’s provided zip code, and sorting concert information by genre. <br />

            <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/">Ticketmaster</a> provides <a href="https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/">their API</a> which allows users to find various events occurring in the United States and allows them to filter them.
            We will upload some of these events to our website and also allow users to upload their own events. So, users will be viewing a mix of
            concerts from Ticketmaster alongside concerts uploaded from users.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app will help to solve the problem because it provides up-and-coming artists to grow their audience and creates an ease of access
            for the college students trying to enjoy live music. Currently, many solutions are extremely cluttered and overly complicated. This app
            is streamlining the process, and making it easier to find artists you already love and find ones you will!
